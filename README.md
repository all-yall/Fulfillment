# Hello
Hi, this is a modpack I made.
Since its just for me and a couple friends, I don't feel 
the need to flesh out the readme.

If you want to use it for some reason, you can use `packwiz`
to comile the pack like so:
```
packwiz modrinth export
```
and then import the resulting `.mrpack` file into a minecraft
launcher like MultiMC or Prism

The java version that works for me is `1.17.2` so if you have
problems, you might want to try that. Good luck!
